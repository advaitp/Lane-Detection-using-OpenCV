## LANE DETECTION

### Histogram Equalization 
#### To run the program for first problem all the images must be in folder and folder path should be given default folder is 'adaptive_hist_data'
```
python3 q31.py 
```
Output of program is video showing the actual video, adaptive histogram equalization output and histogram equalization output.

### Lane Detection
#### To run the program for second problem keep 'whiteline.mp4' video in same folder or give the path of video
```
python3 q32.py
```
Output of program is video output

### Radius of Curvature and turn prediction
#### To run the program for third problem keep 'challenge.mp4' in same directory or give video path
```
python3 q33.py
```
Output of program is video output
